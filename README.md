## Description

This application is an employee tracker that utilises the MySQL and inquirer packages. It is purely for the CLI and has the ability to track employees as well as their roles, salary, department and managers. This application has a database running on MySQL and uses a Node JS file to prompt the user for input and to send server data to the CLI.
